It looks like protecting directories with sensible contents is a nasty
thing.  The problem here is that if the dentry is present in the cache,
->lookup() is not called at all and the permissions can be checked in
fop/dop/iop specific handler (getattr(), readlink(), etc.).  However, it
would be much simplier to hook ->lookup() only.  Otherwise, we have to
define procfs handlers for all operations, which don't call
->d_revalidate().

Is it possible to disable caching dentry for specific files?  It is not
performace critical thing in fd and map_files and it would much simplify
the task.  Creating handlers for all these op handler bloats procfs.

Also I'm not sure what other handlers might reveal dentry presence.
Besides ->getattr() I could find only one thing - ->link() (Cyrill,
AFAICS ->setattr() doesn't reveal files' presence).  Someone more
familiar with vfs than me - please, help to identify all infoleak
sources!


Thank you,
