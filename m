This option only affects compiler-generated code, so I don't think that
matters.

I think it's fine to say that we should always avoid the use of x18 in
hand-written assembly (with manual register allocation), while also
allowing the compiler to use x18 if we're not using SCS.

This can be folded into the earlier patch which always reserved x18.

I think that we can trust the set of people who regularly review arm64
assembly to remember this. We could also document this somewhere -- we
might need to document other constraints or conventions for assembly
in preparation for livepatching and so on.

If we wanted to, we could periodically grep for x18 to find any illicit
usage.

Thanks,
Mark.
